      <p>
        Thank you for looking at my portfolio, my name is Jesus Renteria and I am completely new to coding. I speak, read, and write in both spanish and english and hope to add coding to my list of languages. I was born and raised in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico for about nine years. After my ninth birthday my family and I made our way to the United States in Kansas City Missourri. We have been here ever since and dont plan on going back anytime soon considering my father just opened a restaurant in Independence. However that is a differnt story for another time, this project will be about me.    
    </p>
    
    <p>Im currently employed by Childrens Mercy as a patient access but would love to have a career that I enjoy. Which is why I'm in this course. This coding course will open many doors for my family and I and our future. I am both nervous and anxious to learn coding but I know i will succeed. I look forward to workigng with you.
